# JsonTutorials
Few code snippets I have ran to myself

This project reads a input json from a file (with nested objects)
writes the object to another file with few modificatsion.

Makes use of three main dependenices
org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils for file reading as String
jackson-core for parser/generator
jackson-binding for reading/writing the objects by generating the JsonFactory/JsonParser/JsonGenerator
